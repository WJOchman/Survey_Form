# Responsive Web Design Certification - Project 2 - Survey Form

This project is the second required project for the "Responsive Web Design" certification which is offered by freeCodeCamp.org. The purpose of this project is to build a survey form using HTML and CSS techniques as learned throughout the course. The requirements for this project can be read from the official freeCodeCamp website in the link below:

This website is a concept survey form with the theme of asking some basic questions to engineering students. This webpage has 6 questions, with the first three of them asking for personal information such as the full name, email address and date of birth. The next three are University specific questions such as what course is the student studying, what year they are in and what they like about the University Experience.

The styling of this webpage is also quite simple, it has a picture background and two sections. The first section contains the title of the webpage and a sub-title. The second section contains all the questions as well as the Submit button. The survery presents a small variety of inputs such as text, checkbox, date, radio, email and button. 

The webpage also has a footer which contains the social media links of the creator of this webpage (Wojciech Ochman), and copyright at the very bottom of the webpage. 

I have no rights over the background image as it has been found via a Google Search. However, this work has been an individual project and I confirm that this is my own work. This project has been completed on the 9th of September 2021.
